since good analogy pairs are **parallel**,<br/>we can identify a **gender axis**

note:
- can we identify the direction of gender?
- analogy pairs are scored based on how parallel they are
- suggest that their common axis is the axis of gender
    - suggests we can add and subtract word relationships together
- language is messy, which complicates finding this subspace
