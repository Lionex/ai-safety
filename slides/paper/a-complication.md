language is **messy**, stereotype has multiple dimensions

note:
- _notice_ the pairs of words performed **differently**; suggests
    - stereotypes have multiple dimensions to them
    - maybe different stereotypes can have different dimensions to them
    - maybe there isn't a single gender stereotype
    - _differences in sampling contribute to these relationships_
- language is messy and complicated
    - same word can have different senses: "to man the post"
