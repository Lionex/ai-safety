expected, but **not true**

$$
\\vec{grandmother} = \\vec{wise} + \\vec{gal}
$$

$$
\\vec{grandfather} = \\vec{wise} + \\vec{guy}
$$

$$
\\vec{grandmother} − \\vec{grandfather} = \\vec{gal} − \\vec{guy} = \\mathbb{g}
$$

note:
- you would expect gender pair words to share the same axis
- do not because of
    - noise
    - difference in the meanings of words: _"to grandfather a regulation"_

## questions
    - stereotypes have multiple dimensions to them
    - maybe different stereotypes can have different dimensions to them
    - maybe there isn't a single gender stereotype
    - _differences in sampling contribute to these relationships_
- language is messy and complicated
    - same word can have different senses: "to man the post"
