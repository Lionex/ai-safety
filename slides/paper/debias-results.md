debias does not affect performance

w2v         | RG   | WS    | analogy
------------|------|-------|--------
no debias   | 62.3 | 54.5  | 57.0
hard debias | 62.4 | 54.1  | 57.0
soft debias | 62.4 | 54.2  | 56.8

<small>_higher is better, each column is a different measure of performance for embeddings_</small>
