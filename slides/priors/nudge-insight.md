words **need not** appear side-by-side to be similar,<br/>to have meaningful relationships

note:

### Examples
- words that stand in for each-other
    - similar to the same words
    - dissimilar to the same words
    - eventually override their dissimilarity to each-other
    - tug-of-war

### Implications
- words implicitly associated have meaningful relationships
- algebraic relationships like analogies
