## Bias in language
- **Stereotypes**: simple, consistent, and easy to study
- **Gendered Word Associations**: terms with female vs male association
    - _attractive_ as feminine vs _professional_ as masculine
    - _liberal arts_ as feminine vs _science_ as masculine
- **Imbalance of terms**: difference in the number and types of gendered terms
- **Contextual bias**: Wiki and web search pages for women focus on
    - husbands and relationships
    - their gender (think women firsts)
